[[overview]]
== Overview

This project allows you to speedup re-compilation of Unreal Engine (and UE-based games) by caching intermediate compilation files.

[[supported-platforms]]
== Supported platforms

* Linux
* PS4
* PS5
* Win64
* Xbox One
* Xbox Series

[[installation]]
== Installation

[[installation-windows-chocolatey]]
=== Chocolatey (Windows)

octobuild is available via https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/octobuild[Chocolatey] package manager.
If you already have Chocolatey installed, you can just run the following command from elevated console:

[source,powershell]
----
choco install octobuild
----

[[installation-windows-winget]]
=== WinGet (Windows)

[source,powershell]
----
winget install octobuild
----

[[installation-windows-manual]]
=== Manual (Windows)

. Download https://github.com/octobuild/octobuild/releases/latest[MSI installer]
. Double-click on it
. Next-next-next

[[installation-ubuntu-deb]]
=== deb package (Ubuntu/Debian)

You can install octobuild on Ubuntu/Debian using the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
# Set up repository
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/octobuild/octobuild/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash

# Install octobuild
sudo apt-get install octobuild
----

[[installation-ubuntu-manual]]
=== Manual (Ubuntu/Debian)

. Download https://github.com/octobuild/octobuild/releases/latest[deb package]
. Install it via `dpkg -i <octobuild>.deb`

[[Usage]]
== Usage

You do not need to use octobuild directly.
Just build Unreal Engine as usual, via Unreal Build Tool, Unreal Automation Tool or your IDE.
Under the hood, they will automatically use octobuild.

Also see <<linux-notes>>.

[[configuration]]
== Configuration files

You can list configuration files and check actual configuration by running `ib_console`/`xgConsole` without parameters.

[%autowidth]
|===
| Platform | System-wide config | User-specific config (overrides system defaults)

| Linux
| `/etc/octobuild/octobuild.conf`
| `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/octobuild/octobuild.conf` (with fallback to `~/.config/octobuild/octobuild.conf` when `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set)

| Windows
| `%ProgramData\octobuild\octobuild.conf`
| `%AppData%\octobuild\octobuild.conf`

| macOS
| `/etc/octobuild/octobuild.conf`
| `~/Library/Application Support/octobuild/octobuild.conf`

|===

[[environment-variables]]
== Environment variables

Environment variables have higher priority than config files.

`OCTOBUILD_CACHE` (string):: specifies path to directory where octobuild cache is stored.
Default is `%LocalAppData%/octobuild/cache` on Windows, `~/.cache/octobuild` on Linux and `~/Library/Caches/octobuild` on macOS.
`OCTOBUILD_CACHE_LIMIT_MB` (number):: specifies octobuild disk cache size limit in megabytes.
Defaults is 64GB.
`OCTOBUILD_PROCESS_LIMIT` (number):: specifies max number of concurrent processes octobuild will spawn.
Default is number of cores.
`OCTOBUILD_USE_RESPONSE_FILES` (bool):: specifies whether octobuild should use compiler response files to overcome commandline length limitation.
Default is `true`.
Enable this if you're getting `ERROR: The filename or extension is too long. (os error 206)` on Windows.

[[benchmark]]
== Benchmark

Linux build tested on AMD Ryzen 7 3700X, 32GB DDR4 @ 3200MHz, SSD and Unreal Engine 5.0.3 by running `<engine>/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/RunUAT.sh <game>.uproject <game>Editor DebugGame Linux`.

Windows build tested on Intel Core i7-9700F, 32GB DDR4 @ 2400MHz, SSD and Unreal Engine 5.0.3 by running `<engine>/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/RunUBT.bat <game>.uproject <game>Editor DebugGame Win64`.

Console builds tested on Intel Core i7-9700F, 32GB DDR4 @ 2400MHz, SSD and Unreal Engine 5.0.3 by running `<engine>/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/RunUBT.bat <game>.uproject <game> DebugGame <platform>`.
